# pew3wm

aims:

* read button presses from a PewPew and use it to control i3wm
* display workspace on PewPew display

experimenting with controlling i3wm with pewpew and creating a py3status module for it.

Starting from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/hbrylkowski/3ea9c65b672748b4f6a85074dd6ee311) to get the button events

This works when setting the pewpew to the gamepad mode (doing this directly on the pewpew).
